# Dynamic Pricing Model

The Booking Service employs a Dynamic Pricing Model that intelligently adjusts service prices in real-time based on various factors such as demand fluctuations, seasonal trends, and user behavior patterns. This model is powered by Servi Connect, the integration layer that seamlessly connects users with service providers, ensuring that real-time availability and pricing are always accurate. For instance, during peak travel seasons or major events, hotel prices may rise to reflect increased demand, while off-peak times may see significant discounts. This strategic pricing approach not only maximizes revenue for service providers but also ensures that users receive competitive rates tailored to their booking context.
