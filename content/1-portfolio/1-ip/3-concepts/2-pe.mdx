# Partnership Ecosystem

At the heart of the Booking Service is a robust Partnership Ecosystem that includes a diverse array of collaborators such as hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and local activity providers. By forming strategic alliances, the platform can offer exclusive deals and packages that enhance the overall value proposition for users. This ecosystem is further supported by the Trust Score, a metric that reflects the reliability and quality of service providers based on user reviews and ratings. This ensures that users can confidently choose from a curated selection of partners, knowing they are backed by positive community feedback.
