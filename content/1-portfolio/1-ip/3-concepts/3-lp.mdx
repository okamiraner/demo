# Loyalty Program

The Booking Service features an engaging Loyalty Program known as "TravelPoints," where users earn points for every booking made. These points can be redeemed for discounts on future reservations or exclusive offers, fostering a sense of loyalty and encouraging repeat business. The program is designed to enhance the User Journey, providing a rewarding experience from registration through to post-booking feedback. As users accumulate points, they feel more connected to the platform, incentivizing them to return for future travel needs.
