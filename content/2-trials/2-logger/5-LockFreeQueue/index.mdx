# class LockFreeQueue


Implements a lock-free queue to store log entries. It allows multiple threads to
en-queue and de-queue log entries without blocking.

Key Features:
*   Supports concurrent access with atomic operations.
*   Provides en-queue and dequeue methods for adding and retrieving items.
*   Handles wrap-around using a circular buffer.
