# class AlignedAllocator

A custom allocator class that aligns memory blocks to a specified size.

This class provides a way to allocate and de-allocate memory, ensuring that the
allocated memory is always aligned to a specific size. It's particularly useful
for allocation of data structures with fixed-size alignment requirements, such
as structures containing integers or pointers.


## Members


### AlignedAllocator()


Constructor for the AlignedAllocator class.

Initializes the allocator with the specified alignment size.


#### Parameters


##### `size`

The minimum alignment size required for allocations.


##### `alignment`

The alignment requirement (in bytes) for the allocated memory.

### ~AlignedAllocator()

Destructor for the `AlignedAllocator` class.


### allocate()

Allocates memory of a specified size, ensuring it's aligned to the specified
alignment size.


#### Parameters


##### `size`

The amount of memory to allocate.


#### Returns

A pointer to the allocated memory, or nullptr if allocation failed.


### deallocate()

Deallocates memory previously allocated by this allocator.


#### Parameters

* `ptr` The pointer to the memory block to deallocate.
