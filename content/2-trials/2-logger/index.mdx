## Ask the Devs

1.  I run two processes in parallel and sometimes get a thread logs distorted
    like this:

    ```log
    [178635891] [TID 0x16d167000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
    [178635891] [TID 0x16d167000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
    [178635891] [TID 0x16d167000] [INFO] Log message from [178636121] [TID 0x16b24f000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
    producer thread
    [178635891] [TID 0x16d167000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
    ```

    ```log
    [182741152] [TID 0x16b0bb000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
     Log message from producer thread
    [182741151] [TID 0x16d72b000] [INFO] Log message from producer thread
    ```
    
    What is the origin of that?

1.  It writes into the log as many entries as can while the program is running?
    That's why log's length depends on optimization?

1.  What is use case? For example, programs run from different TTY sessions
    produce serialized logs, but entries from different threads get revolved
    each ~4 KB anyway.
