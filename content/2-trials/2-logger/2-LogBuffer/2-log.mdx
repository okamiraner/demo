# log()

This method creates a new log entry and adds it to the log buffer. It uses a
mutex to ensure that memory allocation is thread-safe. If memory allocation for
the log entry fails, it catches the exception and returns false. If successful,
it constructs a LogEntry in the allocated memory and enqueues it in the
lock-free queue.


## Parameters


### level

The severity level of the log entry (e.g., `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).


### message

A pointer to a null-terminated string containing the log message to be recorded.


## Returns

Returns true if the log entry was successfully created and en-queued; returns
false if memory allocation fails or if the queue is full.
