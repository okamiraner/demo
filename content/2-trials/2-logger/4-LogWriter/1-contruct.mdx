# LogWriter()

Initializes the LogWriter with the specified LogBuffer and log file name. It
attempts to open the log file for writing. If the file cannot be opened, it
throws a `std::runtime_error`. It also starts a worker thread that runs the run
method to process log entries.


## Parameters


### buffer

A reference to the LogBuffer instance from which log entries will be consumed.


### filename

The name of the file where log entries will be written. The file is opened in
append mode.
