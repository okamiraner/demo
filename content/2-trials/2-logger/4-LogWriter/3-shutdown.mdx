# shutdown()

This method signals the worker thread to stop processing log entries by setting
the `shutdown_flag` to `true`.

It then waits for the worker thread to finish by `calling join()` if the thread
is joinable. This ensures that all log entries are processed before the
LogWriter is destroyed.
