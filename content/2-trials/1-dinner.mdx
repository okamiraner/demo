# Holiday Dinner Guide

<Steps>
## Plan the menu

*   Think about what dishes you want to make (appetizers, main course, sides,
    desserts).
*   Check if any guests have allergies or special diets (like vegetarian or
    gluten-free).


## Check Who’s Coming

*   Confirm how many guests will be there.
*   If some can’t make it, adjust how much food you’re making.
*   Think about making dishes that can be frozen for later.


## Be mindful of allergies

*   Make sure your dishes are safe for anyone with allergies.
*   If needed, whip up alternative dishes that everyone can enjoy.


## Check what you have at home

*   Look in your pantry and fridge to see what you already have.
*   Cross off those items from your list so you don’t buy duplicates.


## Have backup plans

If a key ingredient is missing:
*   Look for substitutes (like using a different veggie).
*   If someone can’t eat a dish, prepare a safe alternative.


## Manage tableware

*   Check the tableware available (plates, utensils, glasses, serving dishes).
*   Ensure there are enough settings for all guests.


## Make a shopping list

*   Jot down all the ingredients you’ll need for each dish.
*   Group them by category (like fruits, veggies, dairy, meats) to make shopping
    easier.


## Set a budget

*   Decide how much you want to spend on groceries.
*   Break it down by category based on your menu.


## Pick a grocery store

Choose a store that has good prices and quality.


## Adjust the budget if needed

*   If you’re going over budget:

    Remove some non-essential items from your cart.
    Look for cheaper alternatives (like store brands).

*   If you’re under budget:

    Treat yourself to a little extra, like a special dessert.


## Go shopping

*   Bring your list and budget with you.
*   Try to stick to the list to avoid impulse buys.


## Trace spending

*   As you shop, keep track of how much you’re spending.
*   Use your phone or a calculator to help.


## Check out

*   Before you pay, double-check your items to make sure you have everything.
*   Look for any discounts or deals


## Store Your groceries

*   Organize your groceries when you get home.
*   Keep perishables in the fridge and pantry items in a cool place.


## Get ready to cook

*   Gather all your cooking tools and equipment.
*   Prep ingredients ahead of time (like chopping veggies or marinating meat).


## Cook the dishes

*   Follow the recipes for each dish, starting with those that take the longest
    to prepare.
*   Keep an eye on cooking times and temperatures.
*   Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
*   Ensure all dishes are ready to serve at the same time.


## Manage cooking troubles

If something goes wrong while cooking (like a dish burns):
*   Have some frozen meals or quick snacks ready to heat up.
*   Consider ordering takeout to fill in the gaps.
*   Prepare a simple dish that doesn’t take much time (like a cheese platter or
    salad).
